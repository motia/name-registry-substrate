## Description

A demo web3 app using Substrate and Polkadot.js.

The name registration system is permissionless, allowing any user to reserve an unregistered name by locking some deposit called "name-fee" proportional to the time he registers the name.


```bash
# start frontend
cd app && yarn start

# start dev env (or check Makefile for details)
cd substrate && make run-tmp
```
